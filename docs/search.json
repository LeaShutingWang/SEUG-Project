    "title": "How Does Climate Affect Soil and Vegetation in Different Locations of the SEUG National Parks?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nThe Southeastern Utah Group (SEUG) of National Parks, including Arches and Canyonlands, is located in a semi-arid to arid climate zone with diverse landscapes. The varied landscapes are due to different geographic locations, leading to varying climatic conditions that affect local soil and vegetation. This project analyzes soil, vegetation, and climate data across different SEUG locations to identify the characteristics of the local environment.\n\n\nOverview of Park Climate Characteristics\nFirst, let’s look at the overall climate conditions in various regions of the park from 1980 to 2024. Centered on coordinates (-110.0098, 37.59964), we divide the park into four sections: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest. Additionally, we classify each section into three categories based on annual average precipitation and temperature using the quartile method: High Arid, Medium Arid, and Low Arid.\n\n\n\n\nClick on different time tabs to view the trend changes within that time period.\n\n\nFrom the Sankey Diagram, we can see that over the entire time period, most regions of SEUG are in Medium Arid conditions, indicating moderate temperature and precipitation. The High Arid conditions are particularly prominent in the Northeast and Northwest regions, which might suggest that the northern part of the park has more exposed rock surfaces, less vegetation cover, and lower soil water retention capacity. We will discuss this in more detail in the following sections.\nBy selecting different time periods, we can also observe that the regions classified as High Arid have gradually increased over the years, while the Low Arid regions have gradually decreased. This suggests that SEUG may be experiencing more severe climate challenges, leading to a reduction in vegetation cover within the park."

    "text": "Aridity is the most significant characteristic of SEUG, contributing to the park’s stunning landscapes. By calculating the annual average number of dry soil days in different regions, we can identify the severity of drought in various parts of the park.\n\n\n\n\nScroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and view the distribution of arid regions.\n\n\nThrough the map, we can observe that the regions with severe drought are primarily located on the edges of the park. In contrast, the central part, particularly the Natural Bridges National Monument area, has almost no dry soil days in the summer. This might be because the shade provided by the Monument reduces evaporation, and the higher elevation brings lower temperatures and more precipitation.\n\n\n\nAfter understanding the general distribution of arid regions, we want to explore the climatic characteristics of these areas in more detail. To do this, we calculated the annual average number of Dry Soil days for each region and selected the top five as the most drought-affected regions for further study.\n\n\n\n\nClick the dropdown menu in the top right corner to select different variables. Drag the timeline below to select the time period you want to observe.\n\n\nBy selecting the average precipitation (PPT_Average) from the dropdown menu, we can observe that although the average precipitation in arid regions may exceed the park’s average in some years, it is mostly below the park’s average. When we select the average temperature (T_Average), we can see that, in contrast to precipitation, the temperature in arid regions is mostly higher than the park’s average.\nAlthough the difference may not appear very significant on the graph, we can conclude that the results align with expectations: arid regions have lower precipitation and higher temperatures compared to the average levels.\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, for arid regions, we would assume that the soil water content is lower than the park’s average across all seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter. To investigate whether this assumption holds true for SEUG, we have plotted the soil water content of the five most arid regions across different seasons.\n\n\n\n\nClick the dropdown menu in the top right corner to select different variables.\n\n\nFrom the bar chart, we can see that four of the regions indeed match our hypothesis. However, intriguingly, the region at (-109.9978, 37.58988) has higher-than-average soil water content in all four seasons, indicating that its soil moisture is excellent and conducive to vegetation growth. So, why is it still one of the most arid regions? We will explain this in the next section.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, for the “illogical” region (-109.9978, 37.58988), we explain the coexistence of high soil water content and high aridity by comparing the local temperature and precipitation during the summer.\n\n\n\n\nMove the cursor to view the specific precipitation and temperature.\n\n\nBy comparing the trend lines of (-109.9978, 37.58988) with the park’s average levels, we can see that the slope for the former is significantly smaller than that for the latter. This means that in (-109.9978, 37.58988), even a very slight increase in percipitation is often accompanied by a sharp rise in temperature. This explains our question well: despite the high soil water content in the region (-109.9978, 37.58988), the subsequent high temperatures cause evaporation that far exceeds the water stored in the soil, leading to high aridity in the summer."
